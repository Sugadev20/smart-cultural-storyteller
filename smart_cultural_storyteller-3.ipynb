Cultural storytelling—especially mythological, ancestral, emotional, and traditional narratives—is often restricted to text or oral formats and is gradually fading among younger generations.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 5.1 Story Quality\n",
        "- Stories generated are unique for each execution due to controlled randomness in the LLM.\n",
        "- Scene-wise structure improves clarity and multimedia mapping.\n",
        "- Different storytelling modes (mythological, cultural, emotional, ancestral) produce distinct narrative styles.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5.2 Visual Relevance\n",
        "- Generated images closely align with scene descriptions.\n",
        "- Prompt engineering ensures cultural and emotional consistency.\n",
        "- Image quality is high without any manual post-processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5.3 Audio Clarity\n",
        "- Text-to-speech narration is clear and natural.\n",
        "- Audio pacing synchronizes well with visual scene transitions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5.4 Overall System Performance\n",
        "- The pipeline runs fully automatically.\n",
        "- No model training is required.\n",
        "- Output video is generated successfully in a single execution.\n",
